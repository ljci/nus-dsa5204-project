# nus-dsa5204-project
This repository hosts the code for our NUS DSA5204 Project (AY 2024/2025 Semester 2), which aims to reproduce and extend the work done in “NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis”

# fourier feature mapping

# multi-mlp to improve output

# speed up w/ hash mapping
Owen: 
found the code implementation for the extension regarding speeding up NeRF w/ Hash Mappings:
[Instant NGP in 100 lines of PyTorch code | NeRF #13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXbPeG5PJd0), can read up on this feature and get a suitable implementation

# TBD extention
